# Coursera Machine Learning Exercises
As part of the Coursera course on machine learning, assignments are completed in the Octave programming language. This repository is a collection of my solutions to the weekly exercises.

The main files used for programming assignments are named "exN.m" where N is replaced by the assignment number.
Further quiz-based assignments have been completed. Full information can be found on the course website, at https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?
